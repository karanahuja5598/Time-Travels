# Time-Travels
Project in which an Arduino was used

For the project, inside the platform folder, the code for the platform is there. Some of it is imported from 
https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/hackershack/make-an-autonomous-follow-me-cooler-7ca8bc. The other changes were implemented
to correspond with our group's idea. The other folder is called Digital Clock in which the code exists for creating a digital
clock using an LED Matrix. The idea behind this project was to have a clock follow someone and to remind them that time will
never stop. The code for the clock was inspired by 
https://blog.hackster.io/you-can-build-your-own-led-matrix-clock-with-morphing-digits-a4740977ea7b.

The materials for the clock and platform can be found on those links.

The platform used an arduino, gps module, bluetooth module, and a compass module.

The digital clock used an ESP-8266 wifi module.
